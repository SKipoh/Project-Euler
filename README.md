<h1>Project Euler Solutions</h1>

This is my solutions for the first 100 Project Euler problems (eventually!)
written firstly in Python, and then I'm writing solutions in other languages
as and when I feel like it.
(Primarly C++, JS, GoLang to begin with, but I'll likely expand as I find another
language I want to try)

The code isn't always the fastest or best, any time I've used someone else's algorithm
or pseudocode I will try and remember to credit where I found them.

The commenting will also not always be fantastic
